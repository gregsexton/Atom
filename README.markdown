## Description

Atom is a theme that was designed to be very readable in both light and dark environments. It concentrates on being easy on the eyes whilst distinguishing different syntax elements.

All important screenshots can be found at: http://www.gregsexton.org/vim-color-schemes/atom-color/

Italics are not used in this theme.

Currently Atom is GVim only. I tend to use the default colours when (infrequently) in a terminal. If you have a strong desire for added terminal support leave me a comment, drop me an email or even better: send me a pull request!

## Install Details

Just drop atom.vim in to your ~/.vim/colors directory or ~/vimfiles/colors if on Windows.
